This software is  an open source computer program whose  purpose is to
perform  simulations of  self-gravitating  fluids  with Adaptive  Mesh
Refinement on massively parallel computers. It is based on the Fortran
90 language and the MPI communication library.

When using the RAMSES code, please cite the following paper for proper
credit:

Teyssier, R., "Cosmological hydrodynamics with adaptive mesh refinement. 
A new high resolution code called RAMSES", 2002, A&A, 385, 337

The code is available for download and documentation in
https://bitbucket.org/rteyssie/ramses

You can quickly test your installation by executing:
$ cd bin
$ make
$ cd ..
$ bin/ramses1d namelist/tube1d.nml

Enjoy !


# ===========

Note from Mark Richardson regarding repository at https://github.com/mlarichardson/ramses_Nephthys
Recommend way to develop this ramses code:

>> git clone https://github.com/mlarichardson/ramses_Nephthys
>> mv ramses_Nephthys src
>> mkdir ramses_Nephthys
>> mv src ramses_Nephthys
>> cd ramses_Nephthys
>> ln -s src/Makes
>> mkdir builds

Then when you want to build a given repository, develop the desired Makefile in Makes/, go down to the ramses_Nephthys repository, and do:
>> ./src/utils/buildRamses -M NEW_MAKEFILE -O bin_NEWBUILD

This will:
  cd into builds/
  mkdir bin_NEWBUILD
  cd bin_NEWBUILD
  cp ../../Makes/NEW_MAKEFILE ./Makefile
  mkdir source/
  cd source
  ln -s {ALL SOURCE FILES FOR THIS BUILD}
  cd ../
  make 
  cd ../../
